          <h4>Various Cuisines</h4>
          <p>Different countries have different national cuisine. National cuisine of any country has a few dishes that are eaten all over the world. Here I have tried to collect the most popular of them.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="1" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\borscht.jpg">
          <h4>Borscht</h4>
          <p>Borscht is one of those soups that has dozens of variations. This version of the classic beet soup uses lots of vegetables and a touch of bacon for extra flavor. You can leave the bacon out and use vegetable broth if you prefer a vegetarian soup. Grating the beets into the soup releases maximum beet flavor. Though this recipe calls for the borscht to be served hot, it is also delicious when served cold.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="2" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\chicken.jpg">
          <h4>Chicken Kiev</h4>
          <p>One of the first value-added chicken products we became famous for almost 30 years ago – our Chicken Kiev is famous for good reason. Who can resist a lean and tender chicken breast filled with delicious garlic butter and coated in a natural Ciabatta breadcrumb? It’s the perfect dish for a nostalgic night at home (or any day of the week!).</p>
        </li>
        <li id="3" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\varenyky.jpg">
          <h4>Varenyky</h4>
          <p>These stuffed dessert dumplings with a chewy noodle-dough wrapping are a Ukrainian specialty. The fruit fillings vary widely—ours are stuffed with dried apricots and walnuts, then sprinkled with a cinnamon-crumb topping.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="4" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\salad.jpg">
          <h4>Potato Salad</h4>
          <p>This hearty potato salad is typically made from sliced potatoes, bacon, onions, and celery. A small amount of bacon fat is used to flavor the vinaigrette that seasons this dish. It is most often served warm or at room temperature for the very best flavor.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="5" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\sauerbraten.jpg">
          <h4>Sauerbraten</h4>
          <p>Germans love their meat dishes, and sauerbraten (meaning ‘sour’ or ‘pickled’ roast) is a pot roast that’s regarded as one of the country’s national dishes. It can be made from many different meats, which are marinated in wine, vinegar, spices, herbs and seasoning for up to 10 days. This recipe is ideal for tenderising cheap meat cuts. Schweinenbraten is a delicious roast pork dish usually served with braised cabbage or sauerkraut and dumplings (knoedel), and washed down with a pilsner beer.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="6" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\eintopf.jpg">
          <h4>Eintopf</h4>
          <p>A steaming bowl of eintopf will warm anyone on a cold day. The name of this traditional German stew literally means ‘one pot’ and refers to the way of cooking rather than a specific recipe. However, most recipes contain the same basic ingredients: a broth, vegetables, potatoes or pulses and then some meat (commonly pork, beef or chicken) or sometimes fish. There are many eintopf regional specialities, such as lumpen und fleeh (which means ‘rags and fleas’) in the Kassel area, similar to Irish stew, or with lentils (linseneintopf) typical in Thüringen.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="7" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\onion.jpg">
          <h4>Onion Soup</h4>
          <p>This is a traditional French soup made of onions and beef stock, usually served with croutons and melted cheese on top. The soup's origins can be traced as far back as the Romans – typically a poor dish – although the current version dates from the 18th century. The remarkable taste in French onion soup is from the caramelisation of the onions, to which sometimes brandy or sherry is added at the end of the slow-cook process. The liquid is typically meat stock, although variations include using just water, adding milk or thickening it with eggs or flour.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="8" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\ratatouille.jpg">
          <h4>Ratatouille</h4>
          <p>Ratatouille is another globally known French dish, hailing from the southeastern French region of Provence. It is a stewed vegetable recipe that can be served as a side dish, meal or stuffing for other dishes, such as crepes and omelettes. The vegetables are generally first cooked in a shallow pan on high heat with a small amount of fat, and then oven-baked in a dish. French chefs debate the correct way to cook ratatouille: some do not agree with sauteing all vegetables together, such as Julia Child, and argue the vegetables should be cooked separately and layered into the baking dish. The ingredients consist of tomatoes, garlic, onions, zucchini, eggplant, carrots, bell peppers, basil, marjoram, thyme and other green herbs, such as Provence herbs.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="9" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\tatin.jpg">
          <h4>Tarte Tatin</h4>
          <p>They say this French apple tarte was made by mistake in 1898 by Stephanie Tartin when trying to make a traditional apple pie. When she accidentally left the apples in sugar and butter too for long in the pan, in a hurry to rescue the desert she put the pastry base on top of the burning fruits and placed the pan in the oven. She supposedly served the upside-down tart to her guests at Hôtel Tatin and the result turned into the hotel's signature dish. Although the tarte's origin is disputed, the delicious result is not.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="10" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\lasagna.jpg">
          <h4>Lasagna</h4>
          <p>A classic dish, lasagna is a conglomeration of ingredients that reflect the taste of the person making it. The best lasagnas are home-made and include plenty of ground beef, sausage, ricotta, mozzarella and parmesean cheeses.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="11" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\pizza.jpg">
          <h4>Pizza</h4>
          <p>Traditional Italian pizza is a thin crust, similar to baked pita taste and texture. Each family owned business features their special sauce, basil and mozzarella cheese. It sounds simple and boring, but trust thy Roman palate, the exquisite sauce and cheese combinations will make you believe that every fine pizza should be created, Roman style. So the next time the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, devour it.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="12" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\tiramisu.jpg">
          <h4>Tiramisu</h4>
          <p>Tiramisu comes in all sizes and styles. Most are the traditional alternating layers of cake and cream, but some restaurants create the tiramisu in ice cream glasses, which feature bulk layers of cream and one thin layer of cake.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="13" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\kharcho.jpg">
          <h4>Kharcho</h4>
          <p>A traditional Georgian beef soup, cooked with walnuts, rice, and cherry plum puree, and served chopped with coriander. Lamb, pork, or chicken can also be used in place of beef, and the soup will be spiced differently depending on the region of Georgia in which it is prepared. Kharcho is a rich and hearty concoction, especially useful for recovering from a long journey or sitting out frigid weather.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="14" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\khinkali.jpg">
          <h4>Khinkali</h4>
          <p>One of the most popular and iconic Georgian foods. Khinkali are twisted knobs of dough stuffed with spiced meat, usually lamb or a pork/beef mix. (Alternatively potato, cheese, or mushroom can be used as fillings.) When the dumpling is cooked, the meat juices are trapped within. When eating khinkali, it is customary in the first bite to suck out the meat juices, before eating the rest.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="15" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\khachapuri.jpg">
          <h4>Khachapuri</h4>
          <p>Along with Khinkali, Khachapuri is one of the most popular and readily identifiable Georgian foods. It is a cheese-filled bread, shaped and flavored in various ways. The two most common varieties are Imeretian, circular shaped and easily eaten on-the-go, and Ajarian, a supremely rich oblong-shaped khachapuri topped with butter and a fried egg.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="16" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\ramen.jpg">
          <h4>Ramen</h4>
          <p>Ramen is a noodle soup dish which has grown to become incredibly popular and is thought of as a byword for Japanese food. Originally, the soup was made from a chicken bones, but in recent years, pork, beef and seafood also being used in the soup, creating a diverse range of tastes. In addition to the typical salt, soy sauce and miso flavors, you can even find curry flavored ramen now. There is also a type of ramen where the noodles and soup are served separately, known as tsukemen.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="17" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\sushi.jpg">
          <h4>Sushi</h4>
          <p>Sushi is a dish combining vinegar rice and seafood (although sometimes other ingredients are also used). There is a type of fermented sushi, known as nare-zushi, but the most typical types of sushi are nigirizushi and temakizushi. There are plenty of other ingredients available for those who do not like raw fish, including boiled prawns and grilled conger eel. You can find sushi all around Japan, but the sushi from restaurants in high class areas like Ginza or close to fishing ports is especially delicious.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="18" class="section__item">

          <p>A type of sweet bun you can find if you visit a convenience store or bakery in various flavors, with some kashipan with ingredients inside, such as anpan (bread with sweet been paste in the middle) and curry pan (brad with curry sauce in the middle), and some flavored, such as melon pan (melon flavored bread).</p>

        <li id="25" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\hamburger.jpg">
          <h4>Hamburger</h4>
          <p>This is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy. Let’s face it - who doesn’t crave a really good, juicy patty in a fresh bun? It's on nearly every American restaurant's menu. It boasts gooey cheese, tomato, lettuce, and a zippy pickle sauce. Ask for the meat to be medium rare and customise your toppings just the way you like it, with caramelised onions, mustard, mayonnaise, and relish. Americans contend to be the first to combine two slices of bread and a steak of ground beef into a hamburger ‘sandwich’.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="26" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\hotdog.jpg">
          <h4>Hot Dog</h4>
          <p>It doesn’t get more American than a basic hot dog, sandwiched between a sliced bun, topped with a squiggle of ketchup and mustard. The sausage was created in the late 1600’s by John Geoghehner, a butcher from Germany. They were popularised in Chicago in 1893. Everyone’s favourite hot dog is basically a cooked sausage which is traditionally grilled or steamed. Garnish with mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, onions, relish, cheese and chilli.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="27" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\cheesecake.jpg">
          <h4>Chessecake</h4>
          <p>Creamy, smooth, divine… Yes, the adjectives that describe the taste of a cheesecake are hunger provoking. This melt-in-your-mouth dessert brings a bright finish to any meal. Thank God for William Lawrence, who ‘accidentally’ made cream cheese. The buttery biscuit base topped with cream cheese and tons of condiments will leave you longing for more. Spruce it up with fruits, whipped cream, nuts or even chocolate syrup.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="28" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\tortilla.jpg">
          <h4>Tortilla Soup</h4>
          <p>As long as you skip the tortilla chip garnish, this soup is an excellent choice for dinner. Mexico’s answer to chicken soup, it’s made with the country’s staple ingredients, including chiles, cilantro, cumin, onion, stewed tomatoes, jalapeno pepper, and oregano. It’s delicious and filling, so you won’t be tempted by the chip basket.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="29" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\taco.jpg">
          <h4>Taco</h4>
          <p>The quintessential culinary fare in Mexico can be made of any cooked meat, fish or vegetable wrapped in a tortilla, with a dash of salsa and garnished with onion and cilantro.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="30" class="section__item">
          <img src="img\salsa.jpg">
          <h4>Salsa</h4>
          <p>Instead of Mexican crema—code for sour cream—add salsa to your fish or meat for added flavor. What most people think of as salsa is actually pico de gallo, which is just one kind of salsa. But salsa is any uncooked condiment made with chopped or whole vegetables or even fruit, served smooth or chunky. The most usual suspects are tomatoes, tomatillos, and onions.</p>
